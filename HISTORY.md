To rectify this problem, Mimic chests now have a custom "Appear" animation if they spawn within a certain distance of the player. If you want to see this in action, use the "spawn mimic" console command. If you get hit by a mimic chest and you feel that it wasn't your fault or that it was unfair, show me the clip and we can continue to work on it.  (Thanks Dea1h and tyrannasauruslex)
* Fixed the bug where the Butter! trinket wouldn't work properly with the Schoolbag. (Thanks MrNeedForSpeed96)
* Fixed the bug where trapdoors would be duplicated in rooms that weren't connected to the level grid under certain circumstances. (Thanks thereisnofuture)
* Reduced the delay on the Womb 2 beam of light from 60 frames to 40. This is just short enough that you will be hit by the wave of tears before going up. (Thanks Krakenos)
* Fixed the bug where Conjoined Fatties would make the doors open early in certain circumstances. (Thanks PassionDrama)
* Fixed the bug where the unavoidable damage prevention code for Mimics was not firing properly. (Thanks tyrannasauruslex)
* Fixed the unavoidable damage room in the Caves/Catacombs with 5 Crazy Long Legs by removing 1 Crazy Long Legs to make it a bit easier (#862). (Thanks Cyber_1)
* The on-screen timer now uses custom sprites and looks a lot better.
* Replaced all of the Rules card text snippets with educational history.

### *v0.4.7* - March 30th, 2017

* You can now do a Schoolbag switch during the "use item" animation. This is a big buff to the item. PogCena
* Chargebars are now minimialistic and actually good.
* Changed the Broken Modem sprite to one that isn't complete garbage. (I got it from freeze, the original author of the item.)
* Trapdoors will now be shut if you enter a room and are standing near to them. (This is also how it works in vanilla. Thanks Cyber_1)
* Fixed the bug where trapdoors would disappear in certain circumstances.
* Fixed the bug where a rock could occupy the same square as a trapdoor or crawlspace under certain conditions. (Thanks CrafterLynx)
* Fixed the bug where the starting items for seeded and diversity races would not show up. (Thanks PassionDrama)
* Fixed the client bug where the question mark icon would not show up next to the build on the new race tooltip.
* Fixed the client bug where the build column would not show in seeded races. (Thanks vertopolkaLF)

### *v0.4.5* - March 29th, 2017

* For races to Mega Satan and races that are already completed, the Mega Satan door will be automatically opened. (This is simpler than placing a Get Ouf of Jail Free Card next to the door.)
* Fast-travel no longer applies to the portal to the Blue Womb. This fixes the bug where the Blue Womb trapdoor would take you to Sheol instead of the Blue Womb. (Thanks Dea1h)
* Fixed the bug where Dr. Fetus bombs could be shot while jumping through the new trapdoors. (Thanks PassionDrama & tyrannasauruslex)
* The 13 luck for the Fire Mind build is now a custom item called "13 Luck". It should now function properly with other items. (Thanks thisguyisbarry)
* Reduced the delay for the beam of light in the Cathedral to 16 frames. (Thanks Dea1h)
* Made the fast-reset feature work for people who have reset bound to shift. (Thanks MasterofPotato)
* Fixed an unavoidable damage room in the Caves (#167). (Thanks Dea1h)

### *v0.4.3* - March 28th, 2017

* The hitbox on trapdoors and crawlspaces was slightly larger than it was on vanilla due to having to override the vanilla entities. Racing+ now uses custom entities for these, which fixes the bug where you would sometimes accidently walk into a trapdoor while entering a Devil Room, for example. This also fixes the bug where you would sometimes skip a floor when going in a trapdoor.
* Fixed the bug where your blue flies / spiders would kill themselves on the custom floor transition hole. (Thanks CrafterLynx)
* Fixed the crash when a diversity race started with Booster Pack #1 items. (Thanks stoogebag)
* Fixed the bug where your character would move to the center of the room upon coming back from a crawlspace.
* Fixed the bug where you would be in a weird spot after returning to the Boss Room after coming back from a Boss Rush with a crawlspace in it.

* Fixed the bug with the Pageant Boy ruleset where it was not detecting the ruleset on the first run after opening the game.

### *v0.4.0* - March 27th, 2017

* When starting a new run, Racing+ will now automatically put on the "Total Curse Immunity" Easter Egg for you (the "BLCK CNDL" seed). If Basement 1 happened to have a curse on it, the run will be automatically restarted. [Rejoice, and be merry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHvnxbtHqsE).
* The racing system was rewritten such that you should never have to go back to the menu in between races anymore (unless you need to change your character). You will now start the race in an isolated room, and all races will start by resetting the game.
* Seeded races will automatically start you on the correct seed; you do not have to type it in anymore.
* Pressing the reset key will now instantly reset the game. (This change is experimental.)
* Racing+ now validates that you are not on a challenge before letting you ready up.
* Racing+ now has some new pre-race graphics, including showing you the goal. (Thanks stoogebag)
* The long and annoying fade out / fade in animation between floors has been replaced with something better. (Thanks PassionDrama for helping to test.)
* The Schoolbag will now work properly with the new Booster Pack items. (Thanks meepmeep)
* Diversity races that start with the new Booster Pack items will now work properly. (Thanks BMZ_Loop)
* Fixed the unavoidable damage when Spiked Chests or Mimics spawn in Caves/Catacombs room #19. (Thanks PassionDrama)
* In diversity races, when you pick up Crown of Light from a Basement 1 Treasure Room, it will now heal you for half a heart if you are not already at full red hearts. (Thanks Dea1h)
* Fixed the bug where banned items would roll into other banned items under certain conditions. (Thanks Lobsterosity)
* If Eden starts with Book of Sin, Crystal Ball, Betrayal, or Smelter, she will now start with the Racing+ custom version of the item.

### *v0.3.2* - March 23rd, 2017

News:

* Now that the Mom's Hand change has been played for a while, I've asked around for feedback. Almost everyone likes the change, so it will remain in the game permanently.

Changes:

* Made the mod work with the new patch.
* Increased the pedestal pickup delay from 10 to 15.
* Fixed the bug where the Schoolbag item would be overwritten under certain conditions.

### *v0.2.85* - March 21st, 2017

* It seems to be pretty common for the Steam download system to break people's mods whenever I push an update. Now, whenever you log in with the client, if you have a damaged mod, it will automatically be healed.
* Fixed the bug where you could recharge your active item by swapping for another active item. (Thanks dion)
* Fixed the bug where items that were not fully decremented on sight rolled into themselves. This involved rewriting both the item ban system and the RNG that the mod uses. The ban system now seeds items one by one starting with the room seed. The RNG is now based on the game's internal RNG. (Thanks Rex and Krakenos, and thanks blcd for ShiftIdx recommendation)
* Fixed the bug where rerolled items would be swapped if one item was purchased beforehand and the other one wasn't.
* Fixed the bug where Schoolbag items were not added to the ban list on seeded races. (Thanks Cyber_1)
* Fixed the bug where the charge bar for Wait What? would not show up in the Schoolbag. (Thanks Cyber_1)

* Fixed the bug with the Schoolbag where the game would play a sound when you switched to an item that was not fully charged.
* Fixed the bug where teleporting would cause you to lose your Schoolbag item under certain circumstances. (Thanks Dea1h)
* Fixed the bug where the pre-race graphics would stay on the screen for the entire race under certain circumstances. (Thanks Dea1h)
* Touched up the save file graphics.

### *v0.2.77* - March 19th, 2017

* Fixed the bug where in certain circumstances, the client was not able to find the Racing+ mod directory.
* Trinkets consumed with the Gulp! pill will now show up on the item tracker. (This only works if you are using the Racing+ mod.)
* Fixed the bug where some glowing item & trinket images were not showing up properly on the starting room. (Thanks Krakenos)
* Fixed the bug where starting the Boss Rush would not grant a charge to the Schoolbag item. Note that actually clearing the Boss Rush still won't give any charges, due to limiations with the Afterbirth+ API. (Thanks Dea1h, who saw it on tyrannasauruslex's stream)
* Fixed the bug where fart-reroll items would start at 0 charges. (Thanks Munch, who saw it on tyrannasauruslex's stream)

* Seeded races now show the starting item / starting build in a manner similar to diversity races.
* Items shown on the starting room in seeded & diversity races now have a glow so that it is easier to see them. (The glow images were taken from the item tracker.)
* Fixed the bug where you could see the diversity items early under certain conditions. (Thanks Lobsterosity, Ou_J, and Cyber_1)
* Fixed the bug where enemies spawned after touching the trophy under certain conditions. (Thanks MasterofPotato, Ou_J, and Cyber_1)
* Fixed the bug where on seeded races, the door to the Treasure Room that was inside a Secret Room would behave weirdly on Basement 1.
* Fixed the bug where the depths STB wasn't getting loaded. (Thanks Lobsterosity)

### *v0.2.73* - March 17th, 2017

* The Racing+ versions of The Book of Sin, Crystal Ball, Smelter, and Betrayal now work with the item tracker. If you haven't already, make sure that you download the latest version of the tracker. (The item tracker will now also auto-update if you have v2.0 or higher.) Thanks goes to Hyphen-ated for this.
* The Racing+ custom items Schoolbag, Soul Jar, Victory Lap, Off Limits, and Debug will now work with the item tracker. Thanks also goes to Gromfalloon for the artwork on the Soul Jar icon.

* If the goal of a race is Mega Satan, the chests will now be deleted after Blue Baby and The Lamb as a reminder. (Thanks Krakenos)

* A Get out of Jail Free Card will now spawn next to the Mega Satan door if you visit the starting room after finishing a race.
* The Forget Me Now that spawns after a race has been replaced with a custom item called Victory Lap. Victory Lap is a passive item, so you don't have to give up your active items anymore to reset the floor.
* Added a feature where Blue Baby will be replaced on a Victory Lap with 2+ random bosses. The number of bosses will continue to increase with the amount of total victory laps that you have done.
* Fixed the bug where Keeper would lose a coin container under certain conditions. (Thanks Cyber_1)
* Fixed the bug where Krampus' head would turn into A Lump of Coal under certain conditions. (Thanks Cyber_1)
* Fixed some bugs with the client affecting Linux users. (Thanks mithrandi)

### *v0.2.72* - March 17th, 2017

* Boomerang, Butter Bean, The Candle, Red Candle, Glass Cannon, Brown Nugger, and Sharp Straw all appear properly now in the Schoolbag. (Thanks Birdie)
* The bug where the aformentioned items would not start fully charged is also fixed.
* Fixed a client crash when diversity races started with certain items. (No-one actually reported this out of the 12 people that it happened to. WutFace)
* Fixed the (vanilla) unavoidable damage when a Mimic spawns on top of you. (Thanks henry_92)
* All Spike Chests will now spawn as Mimics instead, since there isn't really a point in having both of them. (Thanks thisguyisbarry)
* Mimics are rediculously trivial to spot, so their graphics have been experimentally reverted back to the pre-nerf graphics. You can tell them apart from normal chests by just looking for the beginnings of the spikes protruding from them. It's fairly easy to see if you just pay attention and look for it. It can be very rewarding when you are paying attention and it pays off: https://clips.twitch.tv/AssiduousSillyLardTwitchRPG
* Fixed the unavoidable damage that occurs when Spiked Chests and Mimics spawn in very specific rooms that only have a narrow path surrounded by walls or pits (Caves #12, Caves #244, Caves/Catacombs #518, Caves #519, Womb/Utero #489). In these rooms, all Spiked Chests / Mimics will be converted to normal chests. If you find more rooms with narrow paths like these ones, let me know.
* Hosts and Mobile Hosts are now immune to fear.
* Maw of the Void and Athame will no longer be canceled upon exiting a room.
* Fixed the (vanilla) bug where having Gimpy causes the Krampus item to be different than it otherwise would have been. (Thanks Dea1h)

* Added the FeelsAmazingMan emote (requested by MasterofPotato).
* Added the DICKS emote (requested by MasterofPotato).
* Added the YesLikeThis emote (requested by MasterofPotato).
* Fixed a bug with the "/r" command on the client. (Thanks to InvaderTim for coding this.)
* The lobby users list is now properly alphabetized. (Thanks to InvaderTim for coding this.)
* Your "save.dat" file will no longer be overwritten if the client encounters an error and you restart the program. This fixes the error message that tells you to restart in the middle of your run. (Thanks henry_92)
* Fixed the bug where the in-game timer would disappear from the screen once you finished the race.

### *v0.2.71* - March 16th, 2017

* Previously, pickup delay on pedestals was only reduced for freshly spawned pedestals. Pedestal delay is also set to 18 upon entering a new room, so this class of delay is reduced to 10 as well.
* Fixed the bug where Keeper would get stuck on 24, 49, or 74 cents. (Thanks Crafterlynx)
* Fixed the bug with Schoolbag where if you took damage at the same time as picking up a second active item, it would delete it. (Thanks Ou_J)
* Fixed the bug with Mom's Hands and Mom's Dead Hands where they would stack on top of each other when falling at the exact same time. Instead of falling with a 30 frame timer, they will now fall with a random 25 to 35 frame timer. (Thanks ceehe)
* Fixed the bug where the Lil' Haunts on The Haunt fight would be messed up. (Thanks Thoday)

### *v0.2.70* - March 15th, 2017

* Increased the pickup delay on pedestal items from 0 to 10. (On vanilla, it is 20.)

* PMs will no longer give an error message when the recipient is online. (Thanks to InvaderTim for coding this.)
* You can now use the "/r" command to reply to PMs. (Thanks to InvaderTim for coding this.)

### *v0.2.69* - March 14th, 2017

* Fixed the bug where trophies would appear for non-race goals. (Thanks PassionDrama)

### *v0.2.61* - March 8th, 2017

* Removed Mom's Hand from Devil Room #13.

### *v0.2.54* - February 28th, 2017

* Fast-clear now works with puzzle rooms.
* The timer that appears during races will now use real time instead of in-game frames, so it will be a lot more accurate. (This is now possible due to a change in the last patch.)

* The "drop" button will now immediately drop cards and trinkets. (This won't happen if you have the Schoolbag, Starter Deck, Little Baggy, Deep Pockets, or Polydactyly.)

* The Alt+C and Alt+V hotkeys should work more consistently now.

### *v0.2.49* - February 26th, 2017

### *v0.2.45* - February 21st, 2017

* Co-op baby detection has been rewritten (thanks to Inschato). Now when you spawn a baby, it will:
  1. play AnimateSad
  2. automatically kill the baby
  3. delete all item pedestals in the room
* The new detection also fixes the bug where co-op babies would make the game crash under certain conditions.
* The new detection also fixes the bug where trying to skip cutscenes would damage you and/or kill you.
* Solo races now start in 3 seconds instead of 10. If this seems too fast for you, remember that you can use the Alt+R hotkey to ready up while inside the game.
* Fixed a bug where "Go!" would appear before the numbers in the countdown on potato computers.
* Fixed a bug where race graphics would stay on the screen after you quit the Racing+ client.

### *v0.2.44* - February 21st, 2017

* Fixed the bug where the "1" graphic would stay on the screen for the whole race under certain conditions.

* Fixed the bug with Schoolbag where the D6 would not be fully charged when the race started under certain conditions.
* The Schoolbag will no longer allow a swap if you are in the "item pickup" animation. This fixes the bug where it would delete your D6.
  * If you swap at the exact time that you pickup a new active item, the game will crash. Don't do this.
* Finishing or quitting a race will now automatically reset your "save.dat" file to defaults. This will help in cleaning up post-race related artifacts in-game.

* Fixed the icons for A Dollar, A Quarter, and Money Equals Power in diversity races.

### *v0.2.42* - February 19th, 2017

* Diversity races have been added to the Racing+ platform as the third race format.

### *v0.2.33* - February 13th, 2017

* Fixed the Mega Blast build for seeded races. If you try to use Mega Blast before The Hourglass, you will get an "error" sound, and it won't work. This is by design, because the game is bugged such that using Glowing Hour Glass while a Mega Blast is underway doesn't actually delete the beam.

### *v0.2.29* - February 12th, 2017

* Added a global Alt+B hotkey to launch the game.
* The "Race completed" sound effect won't play for solo races.

* More countdown sounds have been added (from Mario Kart: Double Dash).
* In the client, you can now hover over emotes to see what they are.
