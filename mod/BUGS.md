# Racing+ Mod Known Bugs

Some bugs are not fixable due to the limitations of the Afterbirth+ Lua API.

* Fast-clear does not apply to Challenge Rooms or the Boss Rush.
* If you return from a crawlspace, your character will touch anything in the center of the room, as demonstrated in this video.
* When you use Book of Shadows and then put it in a Schoolbag, the shield will deactivate.
* Clearing waves of the Boss Rush still won't give any charges to an item in a Schoolbag.
