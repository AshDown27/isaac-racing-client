# Racing+ Mod Known Bugs

Some bugs are not fixable due to the limitations of the Afterbirth+ Lua API.

* Fast-clear does not apply to Challenge Rooms or the Boss Rush.
* When you use Book of Shadows and then put it in a Schoolbag, the shield will deactivate.
* Clearing waves of the Boss Rush still won't give any charges to an item in a Schoolbag.
* When returning to the Boss Rush from a crawlspace, the camera will jerk from the door to the location of the crawlspace.
* When resetting on Lilith, you might hear the beginning of the recharge sound effect before it is silenced.
