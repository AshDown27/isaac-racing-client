    <description>[h1][b]The Jud6s Mod v4.0.10
A racing mod for The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+[/b][/h1]

This is the Afterbirth+ version of the Jud6s mod - a mod that stays very close to the original game while slightly tweaking it to be more fair for racing. It also fixes a ton of unavoidable damage and bugs that the developers have not bothered to fix in the vanilla game.

The Afterbirth+ version of this mod should be considered [b]alpha[/b]. Many of the room fixes from Afterbirth are not re-implemented yet.

Please read [url=https://github.com/Zamiell/jud6s/blob/master/docs/version_history.md]the version changes on GitHub[/url].
(Ignore the version number inside the &quot;metadata.xml&quot; file; it will not match the version signified in this description / on GitHub.)



[h1]Installation notes:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Click the &quot;Subscribe&quot; button above. (Once you do that, it should automatically start downloading the mod in the background if Steam is open.)
[*] Start up the game. You should see &quot;Jud6s&quot; on the bottom-right hand corner of the title screen. You're done!
[*] Using multiple mods at the same time is bugged in various ways. If you are using Jud6s, make sure all other mods are disabled in the in-game &quot;Mods&quot; menu.
[*] Note that you need to completely [b]restart the game[/b] after enabling or disabling Jud6s via the in-game &quot;Mods&quot; menu.
